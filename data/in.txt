When I heard the learn'd astronomer
When the proofs, the figures
Were ranged in columns before me
When I was shown the charts
And the diagrams
To add, divide, and measure them
When I, sitting
Heard the astronomer
Where he lectured with much
Applause in the lecture-room
How soon, unaccountable
I became tired and sick
Till rising and gliding out
I wander'd off by myself
In the mystical moist night-air
And from time to time
Look'd up in perfect silence
At the stars
